## Why this app?

As a passionate movie and show lover, I've always wanted an app that would make browsing through thousands of options easy and convenient. I've often found myself losing track of what I've watched or what's on my watchlist, and I wanted a solution that would streamline this process. That's why I created WatchedIT with a deep love for movies and shows, and a desire to enhance the viewing experience for fellow enthusiasts like myself. Now, I'm thrilled to share this app with others who share the same passion, and I hope it becomes your go-to tool for discovering, tracking, and enjoying all your favorite movies and shows!

Note: I made this app as my capstone project at the neue fische web development bootcamp within four weeks.
